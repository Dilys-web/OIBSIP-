# Number Guessing Game

The "Guess the Number" project is a fun and easy Java application that allows the user to guess a number generated by the computer. The game involves the following steps:

## How to Play

1. **Random Number Generation**: The system generates a random number from a given range, typically 1 to 100.
2. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter their guess in a displayed dialogue box.
3. **Feedback**: The computer provides feedback indicating whether the entered number matches the generated number, or if it is higher or lower.
4. **Repeat**: The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Additional Features

To enhance the game experience, I incorporate the following features:

- **Limiting the Number of Attempts**: Restrict the number of guesses a user can make.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Allow the game to be played in multiple rounds, with the number resetting each round.
- **Score Display**: Show the user's score at the end of each round.
- **Points System**: Assign points based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
